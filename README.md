# MNISTKeras

Preprocess input data for Keras :-
    Includes Defining Depth of image in terms of RGB Channels
    Includes defining data from (y,) shape to (y,10) shape
    
Defining the model:-
    The model used here is a (1x28x28) x (128x1) x (10,1) shape model with a single hidden layer.
  
Compilation and fitting of model is done with regular parameters(self defining in code)

The results appear to be 99.02% on test set and are quite satisfactory.
